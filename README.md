# Sam Greeman's Project Repository

##Hello! My name is Samuel Greeman, and I graduated from Boston University in 2021 with a BA in Mathematics and Statistics.##
##On this site, you will find various projects I created. All plots will be in the projects' respective "figures" folder. The main reports themselves will be either .md files or pdf files. Some were formatted in LaTeX, and the rest were formatted in R. Additionally, there are other group projects I completed during my college coursework that are not included on this site, but you can contact me at sgreeman@bu.edu if you are interested in seeing those. The projects on this site are:##

##-Machine Learning Analysis on Bone Density##
##-Modeling Baseball Teams' Yearly Winning Percentage Using Time Series*##
##-Using Bayesian Methods to Compare Weather in April and October##
##-Using Regression Splines and Knots to Model Ozone Data##
##-Using Weighted Least Squares to Predict Bike Rentals##

##* This project was followed up with a similar project for Football Teams, which is also in this site.##

##I also devoted two projects to explaining how certain regression and modeling methods are designed to function, both of which are also in this site.##

##All R code will be provided as a file separate to the report.##
